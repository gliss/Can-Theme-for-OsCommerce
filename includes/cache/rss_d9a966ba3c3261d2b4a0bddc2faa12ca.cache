<br />
Lots of updates in this Revision. Much of the code has been rewritten to utilize Prepared Statements.<br />
<br />
Three new Screenshots included, Enjoy !<br />
<br />
 - Using the new HTML5 ProgressEvent interface or AJAX 2 to display a Bootstrap Progress Bar with the real amount of orders updated when batch updating orders.<br />
<br />
 - All queries have been converted to MySQLi Prepared Statements for a big Security &amp; Performance increase.<br />
<br />
 - New Order Class in Admin added to make use of the performance benefits from using Prepared Statements when querying the database in a loop.<br />
<br />
 - Comet / Ajax Long-Polling function remade so now it only polls new orders from stream.php instead of making 2 requests.<br />
<br />
 - Add a Product function has been replaced with jQuery Autocomplete.<br />
<br />
 - I have improved the jQuery code to use Asynchronous requests together with jQuery.deferred. This will speed up the Ajax requests and make handling appear in a more linear soft kind of way (No page locks).<br />
<br />
 - There will now be a lot more Growl Notifications when you update orders etc. I have tried to include JSON Error/Success callbacks from most functions to make Order Handling more like a real Application.<br />
<br />
 - More tool tips have been added as requested.<br />
<br />
 - It's now possible to sort the orders Ascending/Descending by pressing on the the respective table heading column.<br />
<br />
 - The Sort by number of products in order function now works as it should.<br />
<br />
 - The Admin Menu now slides out/in by toggling a nice iOS 7 Toggle Switch which gives you 100% window width when working with your orders.<br />
<br />
 - The Order Search function has been improved. It now uses Select2 3.4.8 jQuery Add-On with Ajax to suggest orders while typing. Pressing enter after a search term will search as usual, clicking on the suggested order will take you directly to it.<br />
<br />
 - Search by Customers name, Delivery name, Billing name, Order Number, Customer Number or E-Mail Address.<br />
<br />
 - In addition to the Fixed Bottom Navbar, there is now also a Fixed Top Navbar with the rest of the Drop Downs and Buttons that are necessary to batch control the order.<br />
<br />
 - New hidden button that appears over Growl notifications to quickly remove all notifications.<br />
<br />
 - New nicer jQuery Windows instead of ugly Javascript Prompts when updating order information.<br />
<br />
 - ScrollNav jQuery Plugin to Autohide the Top Navbar when Scrolling the page<br />
<br />
 - Lots of Bug Fixes &amp; More!<br />";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Mon, 12 May 2014 00:47:07 +0200";}i:1;a:4:{s:5:"title";s:31:"Supertracker 3.5 for OSC 2.3.1.";s:4:"link";s:38:"http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/8056";s:11:"description";s:391:"Since v3.5.2<br />
