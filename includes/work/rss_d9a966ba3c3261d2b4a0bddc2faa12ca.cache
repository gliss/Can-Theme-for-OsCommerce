<br />
Made some changes to the code for product_info.php because display of the reviews was odd looking:  <br />
<br />
Moved the buttons to the corners of the box. They were all in different positions before and there was no symmetry  <br />
<br />
Changed review boxes so they were centered and stretched out across box instead of being tall and narrow and making page really long  <br />
<br />
Removed the box from around the Write Reviews button. This looked silly. None of the other buttons had a box around them  <br />
<br />
This is based on v2.3.  I did not include changes from profesorasklep since I was unsure what he as even doing, due to very poor documentation...";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Sat, 15 Feb 2014 17:14:15 +0100";}i:2;a:4:{s:5:"title";s:32:"BeezDesk CRM Customer Insight CE";s:4:"link";s:38:"http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/8957";s:11:"description";s:91:"- improved mailbeez history view<br />
